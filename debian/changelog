php-json-schema (0.2.0+svn161-0aurex1) precise; urgency=low

  * Upstream snapshot based on 'trunk' revision 161 (2012-10-13)
  * Removed incorrect 'source/format 3.0 (quilt)', because conflicts with
    dh_quilt invocation in rules. The package not includes the upstream
    source code (debian/rules 'unzips' the source), so it's easy to patch
    with dh_quilt in debian/rules AFTER unzipping (as original packaging does)
  * Rebuild for aurex 12.04
